  p("The path towards financial stability can be uncertain for many newer immigrants to the United States, who may be saddled by issues such as underbanking, limited English proficiency, precarious employment arrangements, etc. However, more rigorous research would need to be done to demonstrate convincingly whether or not the overall financial health of those who identify as immigrants is worse than that of the general population. For a number of the indicators analyzed above, first- and second-generation immigrants scored higher than non-immigrants or expressed higher levels of confidence in their financial behaviors.",

    "One consistent finding is that those who identify as", strong("third-generation immigrants"), "tended to enjoy a significantly higher level of financial stability -- this population received the highest Spend, Save, Borrow, and Plan scores and were the least likely to express concern over issues such as food insecurity, paying for medical care, managing debt, and other critical financial stressors. This reinforces the need for policies and outrech services that focus on immigrants' wealth-building pathways and enable them to participate on equal footing in banking, homeownership, higher education and other asset-building activities.",
