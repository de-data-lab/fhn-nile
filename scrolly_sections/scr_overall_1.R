    "The FinHealth Score is a metric based on survey questions that align with the eight indicators of
financial health. For every individual who responds to all eight survey questions, one aggregate FinHealth Score and four subscores can be calculated for Spend, Save, Borrow, and Plan. FinHealth Scores range from 0-100 and can be used to categorize respondents into three financial health tiers: Financially Vulnerable, Financially Coping, or Financially Healthy (Figure 2). Visit the FinHealth Score methodology page for more information."
